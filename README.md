## About the project
Presently chatbot development is choice of technology and channel driven (by channel we mean custom UI or commonly used chat apps). Current practices make development of chatbots heavily reliant on IT teams. Similarly management of chatbots or evaluation of Machine Learning (ML) model performance used there-in is restricted to Developer and Data Science community.

The project intends to 
 * Bring back control/visibility to business community by enabling them create and manage bot themselves
 * Separate Bot Core Engine from Channels to enable channel independence and multi-channel experience (example of multi-channel will be to communicate with chatbot via text messages and slack at the same time)
